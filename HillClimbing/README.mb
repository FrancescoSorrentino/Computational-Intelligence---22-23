## Hill Climber algorithms and Evolutionary Strategies.

In this folder i tried to make some Hill Climber algorithms plus some 
Evolutionary Strategies for function optimization, in particular the
rastrigin function (weak causality) and a sphere function (strong causality)

Feel free to give advice on the code!
